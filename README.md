# Turtle Crossing Game

Welcome to the **Turtle Crossing Game**! This is a simple Python-based game where the player controls a turtle and tries to cross a busy road without getting hit by moving cars. The game gets progressively harder as the player advances through levels.

## 🐢 Game Overview
- The player moves the turtle upward using the `Up` arrow key.
- Cars move horizontally across the screen at different speeds.
- If the turtle reaches the other side safely, the level increases and the car speed increases.
- If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends.
